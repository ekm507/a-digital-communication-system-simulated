# Simulate a digital communication system in MATLAB (octave)


## TODO

* generate True random numbers

* check if noise is truly random

* generate better filter for channel

* fix problems with `M` `=` `4`

* add documents to undocumented code parts

* write a nice friendly `README.md`

* demodulation clock sync should be fixed with shifted signal

* check if adding repeat code is better than increasing pulse width

* now fix that new demodulation phase problem!
